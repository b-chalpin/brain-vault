#### Probability Mass Function (PMF)
This function only applies for **Discrete Random Variables**.

*Defn:* 
> Probability mass function is the probability distribution of a discrete random variable, and provides the possible values and their associated probabilities. It is the function $p: \mathbb{R} \to [0,1]$ defined by $p_X(x)=P(X=x)$

*Example:* Rolling a 6-sided die. It has 6 possible values, each with the same probability of occurring.
